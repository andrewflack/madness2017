- RPI, ESPN's BPI, 538 Elo

- Tempo-free analysis
- Possessions = (FGA - Off. Reb. + Turnovers + (.475*FTA))/2
- Offensive Efficiency = Points/Possessions

- Four Factors:
-- Effective FG Pct = (FGM + (0.5*Made 3's))/FGA
-- Turnover Rate = Turnovers/Posessions
-- Offensive Rebound Pct = Offensive Rebounds/(Offensive Rebounds + Opponent Defensive Rebounds)
-- Free Throw Rate = Free Throw Attempts/Field Goal Attempts

- Stacking

- Clustering -> performance against teams similar to their opponent
